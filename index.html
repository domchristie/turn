    <h1>Turn</h1>
    <p>Turn is a library for animating page transitions in Turbo Drive apps. It applies various class names to the HTML element during the lifecycle of a navigation. Targeted elements can then use these classes to apply animations. It supports View Transitions and can be used with a combination of the two approches.</p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="./examples/animations-only/">Basic</a>: immediate exit animations, followed by enter animations (without View Transitions)</li>
      <li><a href="./examples/view-transitions-only/">View Transitions</a>: transitions common elements between pages (where supported, without a fallback)</li>
      <li><a href="./examples/fallback/">Fallback</a>: animate with View Transitions, with a fallback to custom exit/enter animations</li>
      <li><a href="./examples/hybrid-basic/">Hybrid Basic</a>: combines custom CSS exit and enter animations with View Transitions for common elements between pages</li>
      <li><a href="./examples/hybrid-advanced/">Hybrid Advanced</a>: similar to the basic example but only uses a custom CSS exit animation; the enter animations are achieved with a View Transition</li>
      <li><a href="./examples/animate-restore/">Animate Restore</a>: animating restoration visits from native controls is generally discouraged, but if your app has Back links, this approach provides a nice user experience</li>
    </ol>
    <!-- <p><a href="https://github.com/domchristie/turn">Turn</a> is a JavaScript library for animating page navigations in <a href="https://turbo.hotwired.dev/">Turbo Drive</a> applications. It works both with and without <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/">View Transitions</a>, or and you can use a combination of View Transitions and custom CSS animations.</p> -->
